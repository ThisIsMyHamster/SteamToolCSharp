# TO DO
&#x2611; The current code for parsing the XML data files throws an error when the element it's searching for does not exist, working on fixing right now

# SteamToolCSharp
SteamTool re-written and optimized in C#

# What is SteamTool?
SteamTool is a program that very slowly took a valve user ID and calculates (about) the worth of items in their backpack.

# Things to be accomplished
- Rewrite the entire program into C# FROM SCRATCH (w/o looking at the old source code)
- Make it faster
- Make it more accurate (finding averages, min-max, ect).
